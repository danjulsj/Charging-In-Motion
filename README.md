# Charging In Motion

Electric vehicles seem like the future. Maybe they are, but they aren't the full future. Our generation is the one that will live under the fear of intensifying wildfires and storms that are a direct result of our past mistakes with electricity production. Now, we have the power to change our future. Electric vehicles are not the entire answer to reducing pollution, with their high environmental cost of mining lithium and their reliance on fossil fuels to provide them electricity. Rather than charge our Teslas or Rivians from our homes, why not use solar power on roads to charge our cars?

This system's power lines look like those on trams, don't they? 
Yeah, they probably do but they're quite different. Instead of using a double rail to complete the electric circuit for charge to travel... why not alternate the wires? One section of cable will provide the charge, the next section will complete the circuit. Also, the cables don't span the entire length of the roadway -- some parts they are present, others they aren't (such as in intersections). You'll see why below...
Here's a little ascii diagram showing the cable:

## Charging In Motion in practice (layered on Google Maps)

The vehicles we propose won't be carrying hunking 1k pound batteries. No, instead they'll only have enough charge to travel 30 minutes on their own power. Well that's stupid innit? Not really, because the road is constantly charging the car at certain intervals. The road is **not** pushing the car along; the car is running on its own power... just constantly being charged. Just like how you use your laptop while charging it. That way, no need to bother with complicated wiring structures over intersections. I know you don't like roundabouts. Don't try to deny that.
