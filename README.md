# Charging In Motion

Electric vehicles seem like the future. Maybe they are, but they aren't the full future. Our generation is the one that will live under the fear of intensifying wildfires and storms that are a direct result of our past mistakes with electricity production. Now, we have the power to change our future. Electric vehicles are not the entire answer to reducing pollution, with their high environmental cost of mining lithium and their reliance on fossil fuels to provide them electricity. Rather than charge our Teslas or Rivians from our homes, why not use solar power on roads to charge our cars?
